Welcome to my blog! This is my first post to test out the setup.

I built this minimal website to have a simple online presence where I can share my thoughts and projects. The entire site is built with vanilla HTML and CSS—no frameworks, no build steps, just fast-loading pages.

## Why minimal?

I wanted something that loads instantly, works everywhere, and is easy to maintain. Sometimes the simplest solution is the best one.

More posts coming soon!
